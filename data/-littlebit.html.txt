"Little Bit"(feat. Lykke Li)

[Lykke Li:]
Hands down
I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of[Drake:]
But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
'cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, oho
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, oho
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell you[Chorus:]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
Oh, oho[Drake:]
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ah[Lykke Li:]
I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
'cause you know baby I love you love you
A little bit
You would do it
You would say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha, hm
I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me[Drake:]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both n'sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just so wrong
I wonder where my whereabouts?
Where niggas that I know, tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous 'cause you always get approached more
Oh, well, tell her fall back
caught up in some more shit
tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know, yeah, tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me
Oh, oho, oh, oho
