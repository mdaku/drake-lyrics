DRAKE LYRICS






"Do What You Do"

[Hook:]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do[Verse 1:]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of rappers in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, I'mma let those stay
So these nosy niggas won't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying on guessing
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if there's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as we find our exit
Both of the deals, nothing under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'mma teach you beginners
Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner
Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats I'mma sell her[Hook x2][Verse 2:]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, [?] and I write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash
And purchase so fast, you only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to all Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy[Hook x2][Verse 3:]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is something that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back[Hook]
