DRAKE LYRICS






"Unforgettable"(feat. Young Jeezy)

Let me know, let me know, ohhh ohhh
Let me know, let me know[Drake:]
Yo, this is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven’t slept in days, and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways, so I’m single
Thinking about what we had and missing you,
But I ain’t Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out
Baby, don’t hold on too long ’cause thats how them stories start out,
And all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out, it’s Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learning to behave,
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but I’m good
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle,
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin’ from where I came,
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same[Chorus - Jeezy & Drake:]
I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters,
And when you get to talkin’ bout the greatest
I just really hope that (you’d think of me) [3x]
I'm doin my thing [3x]
(‘Cause I’m trynna be unforgettable)[Young Jeezy:]
This just might be my realest flow ever,
When I say for life, y’all say forever
It’s hard, but its fair, I told that girl "Life hurts"
The closest you gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name’s Young, baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young, so I’mma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry prolly louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I’m in my "used to have to sneak the car"
Now my insides are lookin like a snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers,
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
She saying shit in them streets, so whats the deal?
And I’ve done everything in the A, but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life, no two days the same
Like for y’all to meet the love of my life, her name’s the Game[Chorus - Jeezy & Drake][Jeezy talking:]
Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah,
Unforgettable, you’ll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable
Let me know, let me know
