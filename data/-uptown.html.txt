DRAKE LYRICS






"Uptown"(feat. Bun B, Lil Wayne)

[Lil Wayne:]
Yeah, uh-huh[Drake:]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin,
You hardly on and always second,
When I'm awake you always restin,
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,
I just always did my own thing,
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes,
Shit been goin good, but good can turn to better,
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her[Chorus:]
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on [x6]
Best believe I understand
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell my city
I'm on [x6]
You can run an tell my city it's on[Drake:]
Yeah, wrong way down the one way,
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday,
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,
Damn, who's line is it anyways,
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright, guess I might, know what fuck it yes I will,
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right[Chorus:]
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on [x6]
Best believe I understand
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell my city
I'm on [x6]
You can run an tell my city it's on[Bun B:]
Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,
The gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb,
im like a SPALDING bout to take flight,
from the free throw line and slam it down like im the great Mike
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?[Chorus:]
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on [x6]
Best believe I understand
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell my city
I'm on [x6]
You can run an tell my city it's on[Lil Wayne:]
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all american bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket an you, you just a bag boy
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you neva had boy
Hate an I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy
Suuwuup bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
An I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel biiiitch
I'm so uptown, an mothafucker if you ain't do go uptown, yeah
and now im on this ROCK shit,
But why they let me in I'm a start shootin at a mosh pit, haha
Fuck is you talkin bout, weezy in ya mouth now
Weezy whatchu talkin bout[Chorus:]
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on [x6]
Best believe I understand
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell my city
I'm on [x6]
You can run an tell my city it's on
