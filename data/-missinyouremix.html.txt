DRAKE LYRICS






"Missin' You (Remix)"(feat. Trey Songz)

[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO[Drake:]
Nah,
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars
I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would of cared more
That's my only feeling inside when ever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies,
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a misses[Trey Songz:]
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out, do you still live at your old house
Do you got somebody new in your life
Cause I can't get you outta my mind[Hook:]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with why can't I get over it
Simply cause I can't[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Can't Stop) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop missing you, (Can't stop) wish I was still with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop[Trey Songz:]
Missin everything you say,
Missin all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this with out you here
Baby 07' supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind[Hook:]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with why can't I get over it
Simply cause I can't[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Can't Stop) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, (Can't stop) wish I was still with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO[Bridge:]
Wish I, Could wake up and forget about you
Not tryin to call you when I know I want to
(O wish I,) I gotta fight this feeling can't let it take over me
You just don't understand how much you were apart of me[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Oooo No) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, (Can't stop) wish I was still with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO[Chorus:]
I can't stop missing you, (Can't Stop) wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO
I can't stop missing you, (Can't stop) wish I was still with you (with you)
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO[Chorus:]
I can't stop, missing you
I can't stop, missing you
(I don't wanna stop) I can't stop missing you
(Baby) I can't stop missing you,
No, No, No, No
I can't stop, Missin you
