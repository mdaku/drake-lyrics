"Fancy"(feat. T.I.  & Swizz Beatz)

[Swizz Beats:]
Go
go 'head
go go go 'head
go go go go go go 'head
go go go go go go 'head
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, everything did
nails done, hair done, everything did
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
you you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, everything did
nails done, hair done, everything did
oh you fancy huh[Drake:]
You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
in the bathroom flat irons and nail files
spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
in the mall steady racking up the air miles
hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
you say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
and you don't do it for the man, men never notice
you just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
long as they got a little class like half days
and the confidence to overlook my past ways
time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
and look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together[Chorus:]
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, everything did
nails done, hair done, everything did
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, everything did
nails done, hair done, everything did
oh you fancy huh[T.I.:]
Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
from all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they ain't got to pick a career
guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
naked ring finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
triple white Caddy
closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezies
who fuck for bottles of Riesling or bowls of baked ziti[Chorus][Drake:]
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
girl you got it
let em know that everything big
nail done, hair done, everything did
And my NY girls let me see your hands
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
girl you got it
let em know that everything big
nail done, hair done, everything did
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
girl you got it
let em know that everything big
nails done, hair done, everything did
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
girl you got it
let em know that everything big
nail done, hair done, nail done, hair done[Swizz Beats:]
Say go Cinderella
go Cinderella
orgasm blush
lipstick and concealer
devil in a tight dress
girl you a killer and aint nobody realer
and aint nobody realer
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
showtime
go, go, go, go
as we proceed[Drake:]
Uh, 5 and a half em boys
ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
and when I find it is when I find you
and we can do the things we never got the time to
better late than never
but never late is better
they tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
you just lead the way
we go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
and Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
how she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
the girls that got diplomas
and enough money to loan us a little something extra
should we ever need it
if it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it[Chorus]
