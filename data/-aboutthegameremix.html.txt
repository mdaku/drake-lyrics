"About The Game (Remix)"(feat. Trey Songz)

[DRAKE:]
It's Southern Smoke Boy !
Ho, Yeah, Uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boy of summer are here man
Ayo Track, I got something mean for this one boy[VERSE 1: DRAKE]
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around
i made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
by nineteen i might seem desitend for millions
promoters on my ass so im guessing they filled
in i take q's from my big boy popz
i 'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
they getting foul on the star
but its all eyes on me like im coppin some vows for the bar
get it guess not picture me not strive
to land in the top ten slip in the top five
same thing in the top four trust im hot boy
maybe even the top three Trey you got me
now a day i peep they intrests
specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
money making brothers should take notes
see broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
some body get the waiter they need a second plate a
this knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later
my money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up
i put a split in the middle then i seperater[CHORUS: TREY SONGZ]
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game[VERSE 2:]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more[CHORUS: TREY SONGZ]
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game
It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game[VERSE 3: TREY SONGZ]
When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game[BRIDGE:]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)[CHORUS x2: TREY SONGZ]
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game
It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game[VERSE 4:]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
That's it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more[BRIDGE:]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)[CHORUS x2: TREY SONGZ]
It aint about the rims on my truck
Aint about the ice on my watch
Aint about teh coop of my truck
Baby its about the Game
It aint about the shoes that I've got
Aint about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game
