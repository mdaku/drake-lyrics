DRAKE LYRICS






"Marvin's Room"

[Woman on phone]
“Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I’m good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
‘Did I go out?’ yeah, I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit… wine or water
Did you say something about a cold drink?
I don’t know, I’m delirious… night”[Drake - Verse 1]
Cups of the Rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I’ve been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I’ve been drinking so much
That I’ma call her anyway and say
“Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had”
I say, “fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he’s not around”
(Are you drunk right now?)
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’ only if you make me
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don’t have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing that's so important?
I’ve been drinking so much
That I’ma call you anyway and say
“Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had”
I say, “fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he’s not around”
(Are you drunk right now?)
I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’ only if you make me
I think I’m addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talkin’ ’bout bitches that we almost had
I don’t think I’m conscious of making monsters
Outta the women I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it’s all good
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don’t have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I’m ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won’t say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I’ve had sex four times this week, I’ll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I’ve been talking crazy girl
I’m lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on[Drake and Woman on phone]
“Well I’m sorry” – [Drake]
“Are you drunk right now?” – [Woman]
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’ only if you make me[Drake on phone]
“You’re not going to come?”
“Guess I’m bout to just kick it here then…”
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said “you niggas crazy”
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble
If they did, we gon be in some trouble, trouble, oh, oh, oh.
