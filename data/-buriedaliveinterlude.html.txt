DRAKE LYRICS






"Buried Alive (Interlude)"(feat. Kendrick Lamar)

Looking in the mirror I’m embarrassed
I’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I’m in the matter of man arm wrestling hands
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction
That'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you’re my type
And you win it from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, Sin City
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I’ma go ‘n get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize that, and you weave look good
With the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don’t call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we’re in the area cruisin’ in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
Like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach 40 pulled up G
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin’
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didn’t help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing on the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason was the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died
