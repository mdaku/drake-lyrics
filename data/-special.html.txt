DRAKE LYRICS






"Special"(feat. Voyce)

[Drake: Speaking]
Uh Yea Man, Vo, Back Again Like We Never Left Huh
Yea Man, Im Sending This Out To Any Of My Girls Thats Different Man
Anybody Thats Special
You Know I Wanna Be Honest With You Women So Ima Start Off Like This[Verse: Drake]
Uh Look, I'm Bold From The Get Go
Go By The Title Of Drake
And Treating Me Like The Rest Is A Vital Mistake
I'm Hopin That Aint Nobody Else As Special As You
When I Say I've Been Disappointed Im Addressin A Few
I Finesse Then I Groove
While Most Of The 8 To 9's In My Past
Now Get A Rating Thats Less Than A 2
Its True, I Been Talking To Aleshia, Keisha And Nadia
And Shadia, Had To Throw Peace Signs To A Lot Of Ya's
Payback, To The Same Chicks From Way Back
Never Call, Now They Wanna Be Where I Stays At
Now They Got The New Boy, I'm Trying To Move Forward
And Pass Me, Classy, Something Like Drew Lord
A New Me, Cool, See I Never Get Around
If I Dont Change Now I Dont Think I'll Ever Settle Down
Even If I Gotta Travel A Bit
I'll Go Around The World And Back
Cuz I Know That Once I Have It Thats It And Uh,[Chorus:]
(Yea Man; Yea)
You Can't Just Love Me Like They Do
(Talk To Em V; I Need Somebody Special In You Girl)
I Need Someone Special In You
(I Know They Out There Somewhere Dude; Ho!)
I Know That Out There Theres A Few
(Put Ya Hands Up Ladies; Yea Man)
See I've Been Searching I Don't What To Do
Can You Help Me?
(Uh)
She Gotta Be Special
(Yea; You Gotta Hold Me Down Baby)
By That I Mean That You Gon Hold Me Down
(Uh)
You Gotta Be Special
(Yea; You Never Know Right?)
Cuz You Never Know How People Stick Around
(Uh)
Gotta Be Special[Verse 2: Drake]
A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be
Since A Young Dude The Flow Was Nasty Acidic
Ever Since The Demo Dog [?]
And Groupies Are Gettin Brave
Now They Ask Me For [?]
Rappers, I Write Em A Verse
And Ask Me To Spit It
But I Pay No Mind Though
Cuz They Know I Know
Hard As These Niggas Working Man
They Wont Sign So
Drake And Vo Back
I Take It You Know That
You Take It Sitting Down
Or You Can Take It To Gold Black
And Since Drake Done Took It From Curls To Waves
Its Been Kind Of Like A Whirlwind Phase
I Mean I Had My Share Of Women
Now A Nigga Gettin Girls For Days
With Most Of Em Its Seemin Like They World Is Staged
But From Georgia To Bk And All Around The World
Get Your Hands In The Air If Your Avoiding The Cliche
If You've Been Hurt And You Alone Be Steady
These The Same Dudes From Rewind, Grown And Ready, And Uh[Chorus:]
(Yea; Uh)
You Can Just Love Me Like They Do
(Vo We Back Man; Its A Beautiful Thing Dog)
I Need Someone Special In You
(Uh; Im Looking For Somebody Special Man I'm Serious; Ho!)
I Know That Out There, Theres A Few
(I Know That They Out There Man)
See I've Been Searching, I Dont Know What To Do
(Ho! You Gotta Help Me Man)
Can You Help Me?
(Uh)
Special
(Uh; Yea; I Need You To Hold Me Down Babe)
By That I Mean That You Gon Hold Me Down
(Uh)
Gotta Be Special
(Yea; You Never Really Know Right?)
Cuz You Never Know How People Stick Around
Special[Verse 3: Drake]
A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be
Look Theres Requirements To Be An Admirer
Still The New Version Of Fresh Needa A Nia Or Tyra
So We Can Be Jenny And Swayze
I Told You I'm Careful With My Heart Girl, Many Have Played Me
Or Maybe Its Karma
They Say Is A Charmer
Halfway To A Night So I Stay In A Armor
I'm Fire On The Move
A Tire Looking Smooth
I'm Not Perfect But I Got A Desire To Improve
I'm Special
Like Kids In A Graduating Class
Having More Trouble Than Others When Addin Basic Math
Need You To Be Special Like Areba To Cootmore
Double O, Top Secret Agents With Suits On
Something So Deep It Da Drown Me
Friends Are Some Cool Dudes
I Vouch For The People Around Me
On Your End Its Simple
All You Have To Do
Is Give Me No Reason For Other Lovers After You And Uh[Chorus:]
(Yep; Ho!; Were Makin History Right Now Man)
You Can't Just Love Me Like They Do
(Yea; And You A Legend For Real, Ima Give You That Man)
I Need Someone Special In You
(Uh; Yea; I Know They Out There Man)
I Know That Out There Theres A Few
(Ho!; Yeal Uh)
See I've Been Searching I Don't What To Do
(You Gotta Help Me Baby)
Can You Help Me?
Special
(All Around The World)
By That I Mean That You Gon Hold Me Down
(From La To Va)
Special
(Memphis Tennessee Whats Goin On)
Cuz You Never Know How People Stick Around
Gotta Be Special
A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be[Outro:]
Vo And D-R-A-K-E

So Let Loose Cuz You Came (Get Busy Ya)
