[Young Thug:]
Yeah
Nigga, what you thought?
Slatt, slatt, slatt (yeah, yeah)
Jeffery
Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin' somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin' somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to-fuck what you need!
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, yeah[Drake:]
Look, I want you to myself
But I know you just left someone else
I know you did, he did a number on you
That must be why you move so icy
Icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody who'd ever need
Better not give that all to anyone but me
Patient as could be, but
I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow[Young Thug:]
Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin' somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin' somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to-fuck what you need!
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, yeah[Drake:]
I wanna see you do more in this life if we takin' it there
I want to see you do 911, fuck a Panamera
See you when I see the real thing
Gettin' realer and realer, yeah, yeah, yeah
But you icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody you'll ever need
Better not give that up
I'm here patient as can be, man
I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow[Young Thug:]
Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin' somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin' somethin'
You need to give it up to someone

You need to-fuck what you need!
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
