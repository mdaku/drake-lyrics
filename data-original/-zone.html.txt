DRAKE LYRICS






"Zone"

Uhh, yea
Uh uh uh
Alright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow,
Always one level above
If I'm in your starting five
You'll never need a sub,
And I'm never looking down,
So I always know watsup,
A picture won't do me justice,
League in this bitch, Ima do me trust this,
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this,
I got the hand on my money sweetie, you can't touch this,
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario,
Coming through your stereo
Bust my girlfriend booty 'round like the merry-go,
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go.
And this verse deserve a burial.
Don't cry for me, this ain't ma'fuckin' mario,
Yea, and polo isn't at my session
Mr. anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like..
Ok, ok, I'm grown, grown
Party at my house but I'm home, alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn't condone,
Counting everything I own, in my ma'fucking zone
I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down
Down, down
Said I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down
Down, down
Yo, my ex-girl say she done dating black guys,
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
But not me I'll make your battleship capsize,
Get soaked, get wet, get baptized,
I got the full package, a nigga complete,
I give bread, and eat tracks like lunchmeat,
Pursue me and ill put you on front street
Probably get your record pushed back like front seats 
I'm much more than you'd fathom me would be,
There ain't too many niggas I'd rather be than me,
I guarantee those women gettin' at him would agree,
That he should go ahead put a patent on his G and,
I swear these niggas gassed up even tho the price is high.
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly,
Yea, you know my coupe sits super low,
Tops slip off like janet at the superbowl
Ok, ok, I'm grown, grown
Party at my house but I'm home, alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn't condone,
Counting everything I own, in my ma'fucking zone
I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down
Down, down
Said I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down
Down, down
Cus I'm a beast.
