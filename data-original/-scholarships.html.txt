"Scholarships"(with Future)

[Future:]
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control[Future:]
If I could give everything back to you
All this passion I got, all I ever needed
For me to move on and succeed
For me to move on and succeed
Jealousy, envy and greed
Too much of that shit I don't need it[Future:]
I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out the trenches, I really made it
I come out the gutter, I really made it
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Shoot out the car man, no lovey dovey
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
Take the private cause lately out here we gettin' it
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both of the Bentleys
I got love for the city, I juug and get it[Drake & Future:]
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I feel in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they call my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control[Drake:]
I need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships
Mail comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth
I'm the one without a doubt, yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change[Future:]
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
