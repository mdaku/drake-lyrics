DRAKE LYRICS






"The Real Her"(feat. Lil Wayne)

[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I’m just proud of the fact that you’ve done it your way
And the weekends here started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends
That you said you might bring
If they’re the ones that tell you that you do the right thing[Bridge: Drake]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down[Hook: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just met, already feel like I know the real her
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don’t save you
If I ignore all that advice
Then something isn’t right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekends here started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too. There’s things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we’re perfect for each other[Bridge + Hook][Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I’m just a rapper, and soon she’ll have met another
So if tonight’s an accident, tomorrow we’ll recover
And I know I’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don’t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I’m with it, and I’m with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won’t know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain’t your first, but it’s better than your last.
Tunechi[Hook][Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell "girl that you're crazy!"
Oh what the hell? Nope can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies
