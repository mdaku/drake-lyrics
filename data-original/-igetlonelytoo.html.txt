"I Get Lonely Too"

[Verse 1:]
Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We shoulda did this already
Said I gotta email today
Kinda thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely[Chorus:]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely[Verse 2:]
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely too[Chorus:]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely[Chorus:]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely
I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like you
