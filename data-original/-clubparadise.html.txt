DRAKE LYRICS






"Club Paradise"

[Verse 1:]
They say that all of yo old girls got somebody new
I say, "damn really? even Rosemary? even Leanne Seely? "
They said, "fuckin right, they were the 1st to go
It's nothing personal
It's just that all of them women you slept on were working though,
They was saving up
New niggas came around, they've been waking up with,
I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might've loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing
They don't know you... "
Sure they do they're just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "why you even give a fuck you not even here"
Well out there there ain't nothing for me, and I think I need to come home,[Chorus:]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all[Verse 2:]
I be with my nigga chubbs
He in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this fashion week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double cheek kiss
Along for that ignorant Young Money, Miami beach shit
A couple of artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change,
By a nigga named tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feels strange
Now I'm the guy that know strippers by they real names
Rochelle, Jordanne, thick bitches, they just talked me out of 4 grand
How did a pile of kush become the mountain of truth
How did a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it?
And now I'm living a muthafuckin fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yea, just lie to my ears,
Tell me it feel the same, it's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low, and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever,
That's why I gotta come home,[Chorus:]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all[Verse 3:]
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she stopped checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'll never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names, that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say, "wat up doe"
I used to brag about it to my friends, and now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do, is just pretend, damn
But I bought it though, I believed it
Yea, I thought it, and I achieved it
Yea, so show me love, show me fucking love!
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yea, Clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this will be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip about the amount of people I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for everyone of these Toronto kids
I promise they see it with me, we just tryna live
I told 'em we bout to get it, and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit I swear it sounded like home[Chorus:]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all[Outro: Bob Marley]
