DRAKE LYRICS






"Faithful"(feat. Pimp C)

[Pimp C, Drake & Amber Rose:]
Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive. You know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in aâ€”not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things[Pimp C:]
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games 'cause they feel like they know me
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game
This ain't no motherfucking 91
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun[Drake:]
You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like I know you're there with someone else
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
'Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
You talk like you bet it all on me
And you can't take no Ls off me,
I know you've been
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I got to know you again
You want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone
Gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again
Over and over again
You tell me I should know you
But I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
When we're in the zone
You gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over
You're coming over
