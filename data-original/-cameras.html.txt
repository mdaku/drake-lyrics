"Cameras"

Word on road, it's the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me?
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me?
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next thing, YMCMB (ah)
Ooh finally got you right here,
(Said I finally got my baby
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
(Tonight I'll ease your mind)
That’s why I’m calling on you,
(Why I'm calling on you)
And ooh soft your loves desire
(Soft your love)
It’s hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you
(Oh girl, you keep me calling on you)
(Oh girl, you keep me calling on you)
Are you me, are you me,
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
Are you me, are you me,
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Girl they love me like I'm Prince, like the new kid with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)
Ooh finally got you right here,
(Said I finally got my baby)
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
(Tonight I'll ease your mind)
That’s why I’m calling on you,
(Why I'm calling on you)
And ooh soft your loves desire
(Soft your love)
It’s hard to stay away
(Stay away)
You keep me calling on you
(Oh, girl you keep me calling on you)
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team ay
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team ay
