DRAKE LYRICS






"Do It All"

[Chorus]
Somebody remind me where I am that's right I’m at home,
I’m right where I belong girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
the smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do so it’s on.
I was looking for the one now I’m feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
I was wrong now I’m back up in this bitch going harder than I did watch me do it[Hook]
And I’mma do it all
feeling like the old me
you don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
Probably why I’m back up in this bitch going harder than I did
watch me do it[Drake - Verse 1]
tonight I’m into breaking up
somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone, I’m with my people
I know you love it
i don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
its just paper to me
take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
you can never reminisce when you forget it all
careful what you wish for, you might just get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio
baby forget about it
I'm headed wherever this muthfucking jet is routed
you can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
my judgements never clouded
that’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland
but I’m polite about it
baby after you
I’ve had a glass or too so somebody remind me where I am[Chorus][Hook][Drake - Verse 2]
Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
where’d I just put my bow tie
millionnaire multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that parts a given
so someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
and me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
because everythings easier to get into than get out off
but someone show me to the owner of this city
because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, still run the commitee
NY forever nigga, Diddy,[Chorus][Hook]
