"HYFR (Hell Ya Fuckin' Right)"(feat. Lil' Wayne)

[Drake]
(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:[Bridge - Lil Wayne:]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?
And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right[Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like[Bridge]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?[Hook]
(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right[Drake]
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right
Aw Yeah
