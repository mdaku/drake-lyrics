"Where Were You"(feat. Dawn Richard)

[Verse 1 - Drake]
I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can't believe we're finished
My life is movin' fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can't put this behind me
I thought you would've called by now, by now
You could've had my all by now, by now
It's been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question[Hook - Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened (of you)
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you[Verse 2 - Dawn Richard]
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keep looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would've called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question...[Hook - Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened (of you)
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you[Verse 3 - Drake]
I can't go to bed
Thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a u-haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out[Hook - Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened (of you)
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
