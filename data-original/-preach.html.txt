"Preach"(feat. PARTYNEXTDOOR)

[Intro - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach[Verse 1 - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is Party, not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow, I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret, trust me, I'll keep it
You old niggas boring as bones
You put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on, you know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you
Drink one fuck you[Hook - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach[Verse 2 - Drake:]
Still in Miami, most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type, yeah
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid[Hook - PARTYNEXTDOOR]
