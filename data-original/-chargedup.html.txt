"Charged Up"

I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas snitching on us without no interrogation
I stay silent ‘cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watching, I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit the twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all coming, knew they were pushing buttons
Easter egg hunting, they gotta look for something
Done doing favors for people
Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas having trouble going gold
Turning into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come and live all your dreams out at OVO
We gonna make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Corey Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no we eating, niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky legging
Trust me this information is vital
I’m trying to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s something that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer this shit with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or I never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We going live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killing people with their arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up
Have you seen me?
I’m doing so good
Everytime I leave
Oh, I’m so sorry
