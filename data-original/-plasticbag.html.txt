DRAKE LYRICS






"Plastic Bag"(with Future)

[Drake:]
If anybody know
I know
Yeah[Drake:]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it[Drake:]
Oh yeah, Magic city on a Monday
Esco treat that shit like church on Sunday
Niggas look at us like ‘maybe one day’
Maybe one day, maybe one day
But for now a nigga got the ones with me
I be in the club with the bands
Like I got the keyboard and the drums with me
Maybe one day, maybe one day
You will understand how I get it though
Man, it’s everything I ever said it is
Mix the liquors, course, with the sedatives
I roll up with the bands on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me, oh[Drake:]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it[Future:]
Yeah, last time they seen this shit it was BMF
I know Big Meech and J-Bo, they were there
I know OG indiana and Shuge were there
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Bust it out the wrapper, blow it in the air
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Throw more money on a Monday than you make in a year
Oh yeah, order 60,000 ones
Told the owner ‘bout to break a record
Hit the parking lot, it’s looking like a video
Bunch of pretty hoes, high sadity hoes
Whole lot of Xans and we pass them around the table
Magic City on a Monday
We worship this like a Sunday
Oh yeah[Future:]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it[Drake:]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it[Future:]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
