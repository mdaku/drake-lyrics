"Now & Forever"

It's over yeah it's over yeah I'm leaving I'm gone
I can't stay here no more and I can't sleep on the floor
Man, I'm leaving I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving yeah I'm leaving yeah I'm leaving I'm gone
Yeah I'm leaving I'm gone
I had to knock down the wall
Yeah I swear to God that I'm gone
I'm leaving I'm leaving
No looking back when I'm gone
No looking back when I'm gone
No more [x16]
It's over yeah it over yeah I'm leaving I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong I've been here for too long
Yeah I'm leaving I'm leaving you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving yeah I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit in home I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'm a die before I get where I'm going
I know I'm a be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road
Something is said don't say that again
I just been out and bad from way back when
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say then say that thing
I just been out and bad from way back when
I gotta get on the road I gotta get on the road
I ain't looking back no more, no no no
No more [x14]
I... I gotta go out and get it, want you to know what I did
Want you to know how it went
That's why I keep telling you over and over again
Just let me go just let me go let bring it home to you
Just let me go let me bring it home to you
Now and forever I'll bring it home to you
Just let me go let me bring it home
Let me go let me bring it home to you
Let me go let me bring it home to you
Let me go let me bring it home
Now and forever I'll bring home to you
Let me go let me bring it home to you
Let me go let bring it home to you
Now and forever I'll bring it home
Now and forever I'll bring it home
