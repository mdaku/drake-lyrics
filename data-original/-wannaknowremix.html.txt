DRAKE LYRICS






"Wanna Know (Remix)"(feat. Dave)

[Drake:]
Yeah, they try to send for me
Envy and jealousy is everything I wish upon my enemies
All that for them, right back at them
What my mind keeps telling me
Mind keeps telling me
I hear everything, I don't answer cause it's all there cause it better be
Trust me it better be, no long talking or settling
Just when I've never won no wrestling
But he's on a big belt medal ting
Streets unruly
More life for my brother's trying out better things, cause
All my man dem are running to the money
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay
And all my man dem are running from them hoes in the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough
These catties they be calling up my phone
All these man dem and they applaud me on the road[Dave:]
I put corn in for my bro
Man dem keep on talking on a low
Man dem keep talkin on a low, but all my man are bros
All my man, all my man are bros
My man dem will have your man dem on the ropes
I'll have man dem on your roads
Man dem in a batch on they own
With a bat or with a pole
I got man dem that will slap a man with both
Nike jacket on my back i'm looking cold
It's funny how these catties wanna know, but
All my man dem are running to the money
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay
And all my man dem are running from them hoes in the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough
These catties they be calling up my phone
All these man dem and they applaud me on the road[Drake:]
Free Smoke
Anybody want it they can get it, no joke
Call up landlord, nigga that's broke
I only link with the real ones, lord knows
On fo', I love to see a fake nigga go broke
I don't run to Twitter with the things I know
I fall back to see how it unfolds
Yeah, like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa, years ago they didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough
Catties they be calling up my phone
Trying to get tickets to a show
Yeah, I got U.K. tings on the WhatsApp now
Like +44 on the road[Dave & Drake:]
Like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa
A month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough
These catties they be calling up my phone
All these man dem they applaud me on the road
I put corn in for my bro
Man dem keep on talking on a low
Man dem keep talkin on a low, low, low
