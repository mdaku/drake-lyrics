"Child's Play"

Breaking news my niggas
If your girlfriend has went to any
Season opener basketball game
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team
She's fucking somebody on the basketball team
If she's at the game
Right, right, yep
I say bounce that shit like whoa
Yeah, bounce that shit like whoa
This is not a fairy-tale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like, whoa, yeah
Bounce that shit like, whoa
Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camries and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Mama is a saint, yes she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back
I say bounce that shit like whoa
Yeah, bounce that shit like whoa
This is not a fairy-tale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like, whoa, yeah
Bounce that shit like, whoa
Yeah, rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah
I got it, yeah
You don't wanna fall in love I know
I'm not someone you should trust I know
I give Chanel out like a hug I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a real marine soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a real marine soldier
Thank you, thanks Drake, thanks baby
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired boss
