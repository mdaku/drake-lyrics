"Fall For Your Type"

Can I, can I save you from you (yeah)
'Cause you know there's something
Missing and that champagne  you've
Been sipping not suppose to make you
Different all the time.
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing
To do (yeah); 'Cause with all that recognition
It gets hard for you to listen to the things
That I must say to make you mine.
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from![Chorus:]
I swear, I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type.
Tell me why, I always fall for your type (ohhohh)
For your type.
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
I just can't explain this shit at all!
Never believed in people like you!
'Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late 'cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me hearts won't break
And end up like before[Chorus]
Look
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you're moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playin' you just drunk, you just saying shit
And you dance, dance like how like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it girl I'm wit it
I been down this road before and yeah I skid it
But forget it, damn, damn
I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like its second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone don't come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
'Cause, man, it's been a while and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I'm just trying to correct it, and I fall[Chorus]
