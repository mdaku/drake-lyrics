"Live From The Gutter"(with Future)

[Future:]
Hendrix ah, ah
I woke up like this[Future:]
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch
I ain't talking about some real money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch[Future:]
Reporting live from the gutter
I'll buy these motherfuckers talking big money shit bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears did on my last bitch
The money made me hungry I'm a savage
I've seen stars lining up you can't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha
Cuban links hanging on my wrist I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look around see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked outside Buford County came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean I ain't even started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean my shit still there
Just imagine you was living lavish and they still there
Walk up in the crib look pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that will keep it real yeah
Got a lot of pretty bitches I just paid their bills now
Money make me feel good but does she make me feel good
Known for gettin' that guala out in Europe while we’re still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a motherfucker like I'm on my last damn dollar[Future:]
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch
I ain't talking about some real money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch[Drake:]
Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It’s not even a discussion (whoop)
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gon' end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her tripping off of yay, yay
Pillow talking dishing out on all y'all
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what’s coming
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don’t want pets but I’m a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as that night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs who go Karrueche with the chopsticks
And we gon miss you
They don’t wanna smoke they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through
And I'm...[Future:]
Reporting live from the fucking gutter
I ain't talking about some real money shit
Reporting live from the damn gutter
Swear to god I'll buy this motherfucker ahh
