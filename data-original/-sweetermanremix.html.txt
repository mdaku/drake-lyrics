"Sweeterman (Remix)"(originally by Ramriddlz)

Girl I know you wanna, you know I wanna
Yeah, she keep giving me looks
Hotter than the 6 in the summer, that ass, girl I wanna
Girl I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Yeah, she keep giving me looks
Yeah, girl I know you wanna
She's a spice, ride pipe like bike, like Yokohama
She heard the ting bend like banana
So she wanna give me the adunana-ne
She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
I say why don't we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends
Girl I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Girl I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Shawty too fly though, that's all I know
She don't sing songs, but if I go strong she gon' hit this high note
She know she working with the nana
And she wanna give me the adunana-ne
She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
What if we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends
Girl I know you wanna
I know you wanna
Girl I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Ride the pipe like a bike, oh
Do the things you know I like, oh
I'm the man in my ends, oh
You're the one, let's not pretend
Cause the pussy too good, drink too strong
Yiy too change, I'm too sprung, I, I, I
The pussy too good, drink too strong
Yiy too change, I'm so gone, I, I, I
Girl I know you wanna
I know you wanna
Girl I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Girl I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Girl I know you wanna, I, I, I
She keep giving me looks 
She keep giving me looks 
I need you right here beside me
If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi
I swear my life story's better than stories they telling about me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That knowing the difference can make all the difference
She wanna ride me that adanunana
Yeah she keep giving me looks
