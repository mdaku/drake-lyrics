DRAKE LYRICS






"Sacrifices"(feat. 2 Chainz & Young Thug)

[Drake:]
Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person, first thing they say is
"I know you need a break"
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose
I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to-[2 Chainz:]
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, "Thanks for givin' to me," like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers; that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah, it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like the Carter, we into jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah, I love my fans
But I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God, point guard and the two guard
"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music"
So I woke up with my wood hard[Drake:]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to-[Young Thug:]
I was stealin' from a bitch, back when I was 21
My favorite gun was a SIG, 20 in the clip, head one
Growin' up, I was a runnin' back
You never made me ran once
I got shot, sweat started runnin'
That shit was red like Hunt (ketchup)
I'm kickin' pimpin' like I punt
But don't you think shit's sweet?
I'm talkin' sweet, thin meat
I'm talkin' suite like he sleep
We ain't doin' too much talkin'
I'm talmbout talkin' like a speech
Like the President, I kill and meet
I'm talkin' neat like freak
I'm talkin' neat like fleek
I'm talkin' neat like a geek (yeah)
You come with beef, I eat the beat
I'm talkin' B's, spellin' B
Double R, that's a Rolls, paint it yellow like it's dairy
I'm talkin' Rose like Derrick
I'm talkin' Rolls like a Bentley
Like a new car, I got two keys
Tryna score the bucket like a Chevy seat
Then I heard they been pullin' all week
I'm a use her name, like, "Who is he?"
You get it? I said I'm a use her name, like, "Who is he?"
Got some gold on, leprechaun sheets
Deep sleep short for deceased
Big bezel on the Patty
I'm talkin' PADI-I meant Patek
Don't try to take it, I got guns
I'm talkin' guns, not pellets
I watch the game from the floor (floor seats)
I'm talkin' wood, first mattress
I'm talkin' wood, pants down
I'm talkin' woods like them clowns (you get it?)
I got my mink off a monkey
I'm talkin' monkey like Jumanji
All your diamonds partly sunny
I'm talkin' sunny like D, Sunny
My diamonds wet, it cost me money
I'm talkin' wet like it's runnin' (sink)
I'm talkin' wet like Katrina (New Orleans)
I'm talkin' wet like Dasani, huh[Drake:]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to-
