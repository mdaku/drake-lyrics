"What You Need"

[Aaliyah:]
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close[The Weeknd:]
I just want to take you there
He don't gotta know where
Does he touch you here like this?
Let me take the friction from your lips
And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I got everything you want with me
I do everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor, doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby, leave them high heel shoes
Cause I love it when you're looking down at me, I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock your boots off
And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
