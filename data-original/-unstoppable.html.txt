DRAKE LYRICS






"Unstoppable"(feat. Santogold, Lil Wayne)

[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is drizzy
And I ain't perfect
And I work hard
So I deserve it
And I belong
Right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it
I ain't mister fenny
I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls
Caught  up in superficial glammer
Who dress like Sara Jessica
And live like princess Diana
So often they have addiction
And I'm the one that will feed it
But truly you bad enough
Where you don't really even need it
You could show up to the party
On dirty public transit
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids
Of you and your possie partying
Drinking what you get handed
With your virgin island tans
All looking like you just landed
I don't really understand it
I'm not sure I'm comprehending
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spending screaming[Chorus (2x)]
I got to be unstoppable [2x]
Ay ay ay ay you don't like [2x][Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
My name is whezzy
I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard working
Bizarre circus
That's what my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I laying on my back I'm never backing down
So over stand me
I got a condo in Miami
And my door mat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana
But I never pulled a hami
And I got a condo in Atlanta
And I always wear a bandanna
And when it come down to stunning
You boys are just bunting
And I swagging for the fence
Your girl hanging from my dick
Your girl singing to my shit like
A lo lo lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a designer shop
And she say I pick that pussy better than her gynecologist
Hold this
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick
Old bitch
Young bitch
But I be like damn
All I got is one dick[Chorus (2x)]
I got to be unstoppable [2x]
Ay ay ay ay you don't like [2x]
