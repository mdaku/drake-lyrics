DRAKE LYRICS






"Crew Love"(feat. The Weeknd)

[The Weeknd]
Listen, listen, whoa, yeah, listen, ooooh
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There’s a room full of niggas!
What you following me for?
This ain’t no fucking sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
It’s cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID’s and the trash we going straight to the top
Rooftop closed with a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light skinned chick first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends first flight from Poland
A whole lot of cash first trip from Poland[Hook]
Why? Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oooooh,[Drake]
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we’ll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I’m becoming
There’s times where I might do it just to do it
Like it’s nothing
There’s times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that’ll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say “your lyrics do shit for me”
I told my story, it made his story
Tell em I'mma need reservations for 20
I’ve never really been one for the preservation of money
Nah, I much rather spend it all while I’m breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know[Hook]
They lovin' the crew
Oh, they lovin' the crew
Oh, they lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew
Ohhh, oh they lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew
They lovin' the crew
Whoa
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
If we broadcast swag,
Nigga we the news in the city
