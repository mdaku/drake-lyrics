"Come Real"(feat. Kyoko)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've always wondered why you bothered putting make up on
You don't need it
Even tho I always tell you that your beautiful
I repeat cause I don't want no singer and I don't want no model I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
Telling you that's more than enough 4 me[Chorus:]
All you gotta do is
Come real
Shawty what's the deal don't think just cause your simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way hey ay ay ayy
All you gotta do is
Come real
Shawty what's the deal don't think just cause your simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way hey ay ay ayy[Verse 2: Kyoko]
Baby just because I wanna look good don't think I ain't real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and the doing of my hair face nails makes me feel good
Nd I'll keep it up on the 10
What you been saying to me ain't exactly what I need to feel and know
Your the one I'm wearing for and where I will always go when I need a reason to[Chorus:]
Stay real
What you make me feel
It's true beauty is the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way hey ay ay ayy
To stay real
What you make me feel
It's true beauty is the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way hey ay ayy
