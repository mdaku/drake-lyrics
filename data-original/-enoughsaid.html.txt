"Enough Said"(with Aaliyah)

[Aaliyah]
Cause I, ooooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah[Aaliyah]
I can tell you something
But you tell me do you wanna talk about, talk about
You say you got a lot on your mind, sit down lets talk about it (talk about)
I hate to see you feel this way
So tell me what can I do to make it better for you
Make it better for you babe, hey...[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Yea wassup)[Aaliyah]
Really tell me what I gotta do to get you to talk about (talk about)
Cause it’s been getting a little too long for you not to talk about
So tell me what you would like me to do, to help you, help me, help you
Cause I don’t really want to tell you without you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Tell me why…[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Yea wassup)[Drake]
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele
To venues in Manchester just swerving with Balotelli
The fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit’s embarrassin’
They even bring up these niggas make the comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain’t got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I’d give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don’t you ever wake up disgusted?
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people’s feelings have changed ever since I became somethin’
Girls that becoming ladies
And my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city
This shit is crazy
And I don’t know if speaking on it helps
This the shit that’s on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know
Can’t you talk to me
Lets talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Yea wassup)
Came too far to give up
Gotta try, cause I can’t do it on my own
Can’t you talk to me
Tell me what you need
Can’t you talk to me
Tell me what you need
