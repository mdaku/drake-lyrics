DRAKE LYRICS






"Barry Bonds Freestyle"

Yeah Look
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat
And go ahead claim it
I'm about to paint a picture
You niggas go 'head frame it
'cause we getting Seinfeld
On some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards
I will fold 'em with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rollin' wit' some jokers (unh)
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn, could you niggas get any broker
Got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment
Don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock room (unh)
And I was praying I would drop June but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rockin' for Pete's sake
You fake gangsta rappers are clich√©
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I be in your face like "No speaka la englis"
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They tryna be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for your ulterior motives
'Cause if you like it you should stick with me
My money good I ain't ever had to flip a key
A lot of ice a lot of cream like Dicky D
Might cut the phone and disappear like Mishy me
But I'm tryna have you on that trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he'd be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out his cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl at the house with her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
Couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point I'm just poking her body with a stick
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
And girl's keep telling me I'm still as snobby
I tell 'em myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seems like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with waves, I smirk at a nigga if he still rockin' braids,
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page and that goes out to every nigga except Trey
Ay, I'm outta here baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if you paid me
Mister bet you that's expensive cause it's not a Fugayze
Spittin' that crock pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget a girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
He took that
'Ye beat and you put that shit in a choke,
well, I think that I should leave out on this note nigga keep your two cents,
I ain't tryna leave you broke
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing,
coming in the club with that fresh shit on with something crazy in my arm, (arm),
and here's another hit, Barry Bonds'
