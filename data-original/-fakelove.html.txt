"Fake Love"

Yeah, yeah
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was all in
No you can't son me, you won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach, I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna click up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face and it's just not the same
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day, I can see it like right away
I came up, you changed up, I caught that whole play
Since then, things never been the same
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
(I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say
(I don't trust a word you say)
How you wanna click up after your mistakes?
(How you wanna click up after your mistakes?)
Look you in the face and it's just not the same
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)
