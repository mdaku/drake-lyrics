"Light Up (Rikers Remix)"(feat. Jay-Z, Lil Wayne)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ive been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades
Rolex's, chauffeurs, and low fades
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age
The always tell me no one is working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man its probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party too
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I grow tired of these fucking grown man liars
Story tellers, they aint even need a camp fire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This sh-t feel like when fredro star was a sunset park stunting hard in his yellow goose
Ya, and I'ma motherfucking missed target
But a target none the less, and I just started
Was that directed at Moi?
Cant be, they must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Getting busy cuz I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talking in their music
And I just say I wrote it for yo girlfriends Kelsey Grammar
Yah, that's what life becomes when you doing you
Welcome to Hollywood don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you
Just know that she gon tell another nigga when she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes to long
And drink it all even when it taste too strong yeah
I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me[Chorus]
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell homegirl to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
OWWWWWWW, Hov turning heads like OWLSSSSS
Im the man of the hour
Triple entendre don't even ask me how
Con-Edison Flo I'm connected to a high power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G-450, caught the mayweather fight cuz his satellite was crispy
Uhh, yall can miss me with the money talk
The smart moneys on Hov, f-ck what the dummys talk
I don't do to much blogging, I just run the town, I don't do to much jogging
I aint gotta scar yet, you fucking round with me and my dogs is far fetched
Drake, heres how they gon come at you
With silly rap feuds trying to distract you
In disguise in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors
Uhh, and I've seen it all done it all
That's why none of these dum dums could done him off
The summers ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like windows 7
You let em tell it they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as the fonz was,
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama I'm promised they wouldn't change me,
But I woulda went insane, had I remain the same ME
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this will do[Chorus]
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go[Lil Wayne]
Hate is temporary love is necessary
I went from eatin pussy to eatin commissary
Damn I am? the sickest I need therapy
You can buy the answers but you cant afford to question me
First off I dont need you second guessin me
Jail is like third base I'm comin? home eventually
Still got shooters like hot tubs
Mayne I'm anemic still got bloods
I'm in my cell readin fan mail wish I was Amsterdam sippin amstel
Thinking bout all of that pussy I cant smell
Mayne they did me wrong I feel like nelson mandel ugh 
I shine too hard and my lamp is shelved
But my name still ringin, alexander grahm bells
I know you? met damn cause you know damn well that I still got you open open like a clam shell
Yeahh still fly on my hawk shit, my conversation stinks cause I talk shit
Stay in your lane you on that double park shit
We eatin at the top get a spoon and a fork lift
I got raps wrapped up like a gift
And id be over if it was a spliff
?I'm feelin like elvis jailhouse rock
I'm not tupac I'm the new pac
Behind bars but the bars dont stop 
Recordin over the phone hope the call dont drop
Drizzy dot the ball I know the ball wont drop
And I pray none of my kids ever  wanna be cops
Young money get em young money got em
The boss got his feet up vacation on a island
Yea and tell yah girl to send a kite up 
Cuz even if you dont smoke muhfucka you gone have to light up [Lil Wayne talking]
Nigga... nigga... nigga... nigga
Eh ha ha haaa
(you got that shit)
Three uppa
Yeahehh
You need me to do it again or sumn or you got me mayne
(mayne nigga got that blood)
You got that alright bet bet bet bet bet bet bet bet bet bet when I when I can expect to hear that mayne??
