DRAKE LYRICS






"Wu-Tang Forever (Remix)"(feat. Asap Rocky)

[Chorus - Drake:]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure[Bridge - Drake:]
How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?[Verse - A$AP Rocky:]
Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feeling like Rae, same damn Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, more wetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothing like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Brother Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, It's yours
I know this shit is mine for the taking
If I ain't a Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say this shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this[Chorus]
