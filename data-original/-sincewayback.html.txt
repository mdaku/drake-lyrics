"Since Way Back"(feat. PARTYNEXTDOOR)

Yeah[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
According to my, as you beg I testified it
I been alone, girl, you finally got me on my own
I know and I miss you
Know how to treat you, but it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news, like "dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful
We gotta listen to the old Kelly
You slipped out of feelin' already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you were special[Drake:]
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a little sexual, with you
Because I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wavecap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped up if you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you were special
Yeah, you know already[Drake:]
Six months since I've been back in the Six
I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, baby
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe
