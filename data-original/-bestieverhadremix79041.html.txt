DRAKE LYRICS






"Best I Ever Had (Remix)"(feat. Nicki Minaj)

[Chorus:]
Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted. 
We can do it real big. 
Bigger then you ever done it. 
You be up on everything. 
Other hoes ain't never on it. 
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it. 
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up. 
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up. 
She make me beg for it till she give it up. 
And I say the same thing every single time. [Hook]
I say you the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
You the best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
I say you the fucking. [Drake: Verse 1]
Know you got a roommate 
Call me when its no one there 
Put the key under the mat 
And you know I'll be over there 
(Yup) I'll be over there 
Shawty, I'll be over there 
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there 
Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice 
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice 
Always felt like you was so accustom to the fast life 
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life 
Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on 
Thats when your the prettiest 
I hope that you don take it wrong 
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along 
You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home 
And she a patient in my waiting room 
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume 
And until them girls prove it 
I'm the one to Never get confused with Cause. [Chorus][Nicki Minaj: Verse 2]
Ayo you da only one that see the real Nicki 
I could show you chill Nicki Cause of how you deal wit me 
When dey knock my blocks down you come and you build with me 
Even though you real busy 
Youse da fuckin real Drizzy 
It's so amazing I figured out this world is ours with tha taking 
I figured out that when I go out an all those people scream thats some of them are living varcariously for me 
That's why I put that "S" on ma chest and I'm gone 
But on another note let's have sex in my dorm 
And imma make you beg cause you look pretty when you beggin 
So meet me on the campus I'll be there around 11. 
So lemme put my books down 
Exscuse me if I look down 
Guess imma little nervous 
But I'm at your service 
Look at what you took down [Chorus][Drake: Verse 3]
Sex, Love, Pain 
Baby I be on that tank shit 
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk 
When my album drop 
Bitches will buy it for the picture 
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister 
Magazine paper girl 
But money ain't the issue 
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial 
She call me the referee 
Cause I be so official 
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo pussy whistle 
Like the Andy Griffith theme song 
And who told you to put them jeans on 
double cup love 
You the one I lean on 
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo pheen on 
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot 
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot 
Get it from the back 
And make yo fucking bra strap pop 
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots [Chorus][Hook]
I say you the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
You the fucking best. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had. 
Best I ever had.
