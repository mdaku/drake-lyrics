"Change Locations"(with Future)

[Future:]
Yeah, know how nights like this go
OVOFBG[Future:]
60 naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitresses
When you gettin' a lot of money you can't ever save it[Drake:]
But tonight, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend[Future:]
This adderall got me to the ceiling
I think them percocets had me in my feelings
I peel them hundreds on hundreds
I get money on money
I get guala on guala
I get dollars on dollars then throw out them dollars them bitches gonna holla
I got more style than stylists
I like that money is money is piling
I see that money just piling
I see it's piling and piling and piling
And piling and piling and piling
We do them favors, them bitches do cater
We go fuck models then fuck go fuck neighbors
Fuck all the strippers then we go fuck waitresses, yeah[Future:]
60 naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitresses
When you gettin' a lot of money you can't ever save it[Drake:]
But tonight, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend[Drake:]
2 in the morning my mind is on you
4 in the morning it still hasn't moved
Hit me to tell me you get off at 10
Come here, I make sure you get off again
Roxx got a case but they get off again
Fuck all the opps and the shots that they send
I let off first then I let off again
You may not hear from them ever again
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Reps Up, you know there a hundred of them
FBGOVO, hundred percent
Don't ask no shit when it come to my set
Don't ask no shit when it come to my set
FBGOVO, hundred percent, yeah
6 summers straight and I run it again[Future:]
60 naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitresses
When you gettin' a lot of money you can't ever save it[Drake:]
But tonight, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend[Future:]
60 naked bitches sitting, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Take it to the head baby, penetration
Money not a problem, you can finger trace it
Drinking on the syrup, taking medications
After this club we just change locations
After this club we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locations
