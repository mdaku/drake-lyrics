"Hype (Remix)"(feat. Lil Wayne)

[Intro - Baka:]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]
I pull up on you in that purple thing bumpin' Purple Rain
Singin' "Purple Rain, " sippin' purple rain
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
It's a different world, it's Dewayne Wayne, oh Lord
Okay now we got some action
Fuck models out of Maxim
I'm too wavy, I'm a captain
Okay now we got some rapids
Orange bottle full of tablets
Okay now we got some habits
Smokin' cookies, sippin' lean
Okay now we got some balance
You see my team is right next to me
You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank her for takin' my breath from me
But the second me gon' be the better me
J.R. Smith with the shot
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
I call my AK Barney
And I'm a let this baby pop
Pull up on you like Steph Curry
With my foot up on you like F worries
Been outchea since Keith Murray
Codeine got me with pink urine
So you know I don't have the energy
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes
And I don't have the sympathy[Hook - Drake:]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done[Verse 2 - Drake:]
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me[Hook - Drake:]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done[Verse 3 - Drake:]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'm a have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me[Hook - Drake:]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
