"Shut It Down"(feat. The-Dream)

[Drake:]
These girls ain’t got nothing on you
uhh, say baby I had to mention
that if you were a star you’d be the one I’m searching for
all the girls they got attention
but I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
its obvious you’re pretty
heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
and if there’s nothing wrong, got this little song
for you to get ready to
put those fucking heels on and work it girl
let that mirror show you what you're doing
put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebody’s taking pictures[Chorus:]
Shut it down down down
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it down down down
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it, hey oh
these girls aint got nothing on you,
nothing on you[The Dream:]
Girl you’re the greatest
and if he say you aint
girl he’s out his mind
you’re the finest
and if he say you aint
that boy done lost his mind
hey baby, everytime you come around
shut it down like computers
hey lady, step into my heart
and put you in the louboutins
what you want
what you need
I can be your everything
them other niggas
just wanna hit it but if they had it
wouldn’t know what to do with it
(and together)[Drake & The Dream:]
We shut it down down down
they know we shut it down down down
your the baddest girl around, round round
they notice, they notice[repeated][The Dream:]
TMZ, concrete loop
you shut that muthfucker down down
ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
you shut that muthafucker down down down[Drake:]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut them down, Onyx
no, you’re not imagining, they’re looking at you long stares
even though she’s standing out she looks like she belongs here
you feel the hours pass, until you find somethin’
I feel like when she moves – the time doesn’t
yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
and your cousin fine, but she don’t have my heart beating in double time
you just shut it down, girl
who told the cops where the party was?
why do I feel like I found The One?
what’s in these shots that you ordered us?
damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down[Drake & The Dream:]
You shut that shit down (down down down)
you shut it down (down down down)
you shut it down (down down down)
you shut it down (down down down)
you shut it down (down down down)
you shut it, ohh
they notice, they notice[The Dream:]
You looking good girl
go go go get em girl,
go go go hit em girl
go go go go go go
you looking good girl
go go go get em girl,
go go go hit em girl
go go go go go go
you shut it down[Drake:]
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
all just happen, when you pass my way
what can I do to make you stay
I know its getting late
but girl I don’t want you to leave
you tell me you’re just not the type
you wanna do this right
and I’m not tryin to say I don’t believe you
but I refuse to feel ashamed
and if you feel the same
does waiting really make us better people?
take those fuckin heels off its worth it girl
nothing is what I can picture you in
so take that fuckin dress off I swear you won’t forget me
you’ll be happy that you let me lay you down down down
tryin to lay you down down down
you still the baddest girl around round round
they notice, they notice
let me lay you down down down
tryin to lay you down down down
you still the baddest girl around round round
they notice, they notice
You would shut it...
