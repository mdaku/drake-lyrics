"Own It"

[Intro]
Own it
It's yours [x2][Verse 1]
Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is?
It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you oh oh
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend no oh
Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
It's yours[Hook (x2)]
Own it [x16]
I said go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Go own that shit[Verse 2]
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (trippin')
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry" (and u know)
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline
You should call
When the last time you did something for the first time?
You have done it all, I swear to God
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours[Outro]
Own it [x17]
The shit
Own it, own it
It's yours, yeah
It's yours, own it
Own it
Own it
Own it
Own it
Baby, own it
It's yours
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit
