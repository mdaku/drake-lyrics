"I'm The Plug"(with Future)

[Future:]
Draped in all designer, draped in all designer
Draped in all designer, draped in all designer[Future:]
I got all exotic bitches you gon' think I'm racist
I just called a gang of bitches out of immigration
You gon' think we printing money cause the way we make it
I got all these fucking whips and ain't got no payments[Future:]
Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really[Future:]
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
I dropped a few whoopty whoops in my cup
Put it on my tab put her on my tab
Franchise tag on me Bron Bron
Steph Curry wrists nigga Oakland
Percies for the bitches Bishop magic Don Juan
Standing ovation and an encore
And I keep the check Nike concord[Future:]
Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me
Got a gang of broads riding with me, on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really[Future:]
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug[Drake:]
Whole time I was ready
They was like "hold up wait a minute" I was like "nah nigga let's get it"
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already
If you come here trying to take some there's a lot more where that came from
And it really ain't no thing, I got Summer P in this thing
I just drop the jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Ya, ya up and away
Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May
We doing 300 records a day
Who really think they can get in the way
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter they hurting
Look at the business mergers
Throwed back when I'm swerving
Big body my Suburban
Everything I do on purpose
I'm blowing up like I'm urgent
And she was acting like a virgin
I gave it to her then I curved her[Future:]
Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really[Future:]
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
