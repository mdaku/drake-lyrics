DRAKE LYRICS






"Thrill Is Gone"

[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone [x2][Verse 1: Drake]
Look,
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin
Because They Swimmin In Women
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors
They Come In Secret Flavors
Thats Why I Envy Omar
Because So Far
And Thats Some Higher Learning
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot
With The Tires Burnin
And Im A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith
In Any Female Thats Askin What I Was Earnin
I Met This Recent Lady
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me
Its Like Im Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy
Now Im Out Of Both And I've Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately
Im All Alone, I Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone[Verse 2: Drake]
Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces
Circling Workplaces
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is
They Get To First Bases
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin
He Wanna Know What The First Trace Is
Now You Like Macgyver
Cuz You Sneakin Around
And She Dont Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her
I Cant Relate To That
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact
I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It
With [?] And They Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In
And In The End I Listen But I Dont See Me As They Do
Cuz Its My Opinion, My Life, My Potentials For My Wife
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World
Maybe Im Confused About What I Desire From Girls
Either Way Im All Alone, Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone[Verse 3: Drake]
Check,
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet
But Theres Logic Behind It
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It
I Tend To Freak With This
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss
Thinkin She Been Spoiled
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days
And Come Up With Tin Foil
We Could Dissect It See
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing
Gave Her Nothing
Her Reputations In Jeopardy
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me
For Thinkin That Exists, I Got A Feeling Im Wrong
Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh[Chorus:]
Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost
Love Is Gone
