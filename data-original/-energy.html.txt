DRAKE LYRICS






"Energy"

Lickwood means rewind, a gunshot means forward
You requested it so we rewind
Yeah
Way, way, way up
Turn it all up
Yeah
Look
I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online that ain't part of my day
I got real shit poppin' with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
I got two mortgages, thirty million in total
I got niggas that'll still try fuckin' me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yea
I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin' shit just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I heard everybody talking bout what they gonna be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts so all my niggas are free
Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well run up when you see me then and we gon' see
I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
Naw, fuck all of you niggas I ain't finished
Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a go
Y'all don't wanna see wayne win 50 award
I got real ones livin' past Kennedy Road
I got real ones with me everywhere that I go
I'm tryna tell ya, I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Every time I see 'em somethin' wrong with they memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne!
Yeah
Run up
I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
