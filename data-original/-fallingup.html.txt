DRAKE LYRICS






"Falling Up"(feat. Elijah)

Take you back,
Take you back,
That was such a lie.
Every time you said you loved me, you can't look me in my eyes,
And I beg you for the truth, so much goin' thru my mind,
And my father did just pass, to make my problems multiply,
And I know nobody's perfect, but you finally crossed the line,
And I gave you everything, but you was never satisfied,
And you said I was the one, just like you told another five,
Feel like it's a competition against all these other guys.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Every time I see you, feels like time is moving slow,
It's unfortunate for me, I have some trouble letting go,
Even though it's in the past, I just felt like you should know.
And you hate me when I get high, but you're the reason that I smoke.
Girl quit playin',
Girl quit playin',
You ain't love me from the start,
You're the reason that I feel this way, 
You broke my fuckin' heart,
And I gave you all my trust, but you just tore it all apart,
Now you're all I think about while I'm layin' in the dark.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Been a couple months and you're beggin' for me back,
And I love all the attention, I'm not sure how I should act,
And you're saying that you miss me, I refuse to say it back,
Even though I still do want you, I don't have the time for that,
'Cause these women stay the same, while this nigga's chasin' cash,
And your problems are so small, girl just trust me they ain't bad,
'Cause you cryin' bout a nigga while I'm cryin' bout my dad,
And its eating me alive, should've taken me instead.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
