DRAKE LYRICS






"Up All Night"(feat. Nicki Minaj)

[Drake:]
Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches, yeah
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does[Chorus - Drake:]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night
Whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team
Man I love my team
I would die for them niggas (oooh)[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, if Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I got that kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keep sake
Bought the president the Louis presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain't talking about the Peach state
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweepstakes (hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you look like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team
Young Money till the death of me[Chorus][Nicki Minaj:]
I mean we can even rock them shoes if it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know
I mean, I mean but then again who ..who..who looks at the price tag, you know[Drake:]
Oh yeah we in this bitch
Oww, oww, oww
Oh yeah we in this bitch
Oww, oww, oww[Chorus repeated]
