"What If I Kissed You"

What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can you afford to be open with all these emotions
If you were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Not a problem ....
And you just be mine
And you just be mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine
What if I kissed you right now[x3]
Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off our shoulders
Tell on me I don't mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie..
…admit that I'm yours
I don't really care who knows it
can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
if we were a secret
tell me could you keep it?
keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
nuttin but mine,
talking but mine,
now you're all mine
and you… you.. you…
and you just be mine (just be mine)
and you just be mine.. all mine
and you just be mine (just, just be mine)
and you just be mine.. all mine
What if I kissed you right now
What if I kissed you right now
just be mine (just be mine)
and you just be mine.. all mine
and you just be mine (just, just be mine)
and you just be mine.. all mine
