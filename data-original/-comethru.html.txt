"Come Thru"

[Talking]
We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon... and nothing was the same[Verse 1]
Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something[Hook:]
Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru[Verse 2]
Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4 AM when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something[Hook]
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been... Why has it been...
Who you been crying to?
Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in?
Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight,
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh,
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
